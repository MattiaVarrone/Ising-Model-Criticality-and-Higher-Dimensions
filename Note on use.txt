COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE ISING MODEL

important folders:
    data: contains .npz files holding arrays with useful stats used by the jupyter notebooks
    pics: all plots labeled and at high resolution

.py scripts:
    Ising: defines Lattice class
    spec_heat: defines Onsager's specific heat function

Notebooks:
    Ising_note: contains miscellaneous plots
    EquPlots: equilibrium plots
    critical_exp: critical exponents for 2d ising
    Finite size scalings: plots for different lattice sizes and fit of coefficient nu and T_{crit}
    Hysteresis: hysteresis plots
    higher_dims: nice plots in dimensions 3, 4, 5
    3D2, 4D2, 5D2: critical exponents in dimensions 3, 4, 5
